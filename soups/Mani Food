Ingredients:
1 cup raw peanuts (or peanut butter)
1 lb (450 g) beef or chicken (optional)
1 large onion, finely chopped
2 garlic cloves, minced
2 carrots, chopped
2 potatoes, peeled and chopped
1 cup peas (optional)
½ cup rice or small pasta
6 cups chicken or beef broth
1 tsp ground cumin
Salt and pepper to taste
2 tbsp oil or butter
Fresh parsley or cilantro, chopped (for garnish)
Fried potato sticks (for garnish)
Instructions:
Prepare the peanuts:

If using raw peanuts, blend them with a cup of water until smooth. If using peanut butter, dilute it in a bit of water to make it more liquid.
Cook the meat (optional):

In a large pot, heat the oil or butter. Add the beef or chicken and brown the pieces on all sides. Remove and set aside.
Sauté vegetables:

In the same pot, add the onions and garlic, and sauté until soft and translucent.
Simmer the soup:

Add the broth, carrots, potatoes, and the previously cooked meat (if using) back to the pot. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to simmer for about 20 minutes until the vegetables are tender.
Add rice or pasta:

Add the rice or pasta to the soup and cook for another 10 minutes until done.
Stir in peanuts:

Slowly pour the blended peanut mixture into the soup while stirring. Simmer for another 10 minutes, letting the flavors meld together.
Season:

Add cumin, salt, and pepper to taste.
Garnish and serve:

Serve the soup hot, garnished with fresh parsley or cilantro and fried potato sticks on top.
